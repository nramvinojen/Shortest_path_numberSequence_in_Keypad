We wish to compute the laziest way to dial given n-digit number on a standard push button
telephone (with 12 keys) using two fingers. We assume that the two fingers start out on the * and
# keys, and that the effort required to move a finger from one button to another is proportional to
the Euclidean distance between them (assume that the digit "1" is at position (0, 0), and the digit
"5" at position (1,1)). Design an algorithm in python that computes the method of dialing that
involves moving your fingers the smallest amount of total distance.

For instance, if telephone_number = "110", the function should return the following output:
(4.0, [('*', '#'), ('1', '#'), ('1', '#'), ('1', '0')])
